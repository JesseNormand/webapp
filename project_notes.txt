> Assessment 3 changes to TicketController:
Change RequestMapping to method-specific annotations &mdash; You've correctly used @PostMapping, @GetMapping, and @DeleteMapping.

Accept a single @RequestBody parameter instead of multiple @RequestParams in createTicket() &mdash; Your createTicket() method now takes Ticket ticket as input and relies on Jackson for deserialization.

Use polymorphic deserialization &mdash; Assuming you've already annotated the Ticket class with @JsonTypeInfo and @JsonSubTypes, your controller is now correctly set up to deserialize into BugTicket or TaskTicket.

Write ticket content to a file &mdash; Youâ€™ve preserved this functionality using FileWriter.

Add a /ticket/delete endpoint &mdash; You've correctly added @DeleteMapping("/ticket/delete"), checked if the file exists, attempted to delete it, and returned the file name or an empty string.
